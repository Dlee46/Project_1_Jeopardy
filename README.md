# Project_1_Jeopardy
Project 1 was the first project created after being introduced to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project was Jeopardy, which is a quiz game where the user gets to choose the next question by choosing from a category and then choosing a point amount (100 to 500). The questions are phrased as answers and the user chooses from a list of 3 questions that match the answer. In the future I would like to make the code DRY, as well as, fix some features like the score board.
